# Understanding Kickstarter Trends

Using out-of-the-box Excel tools we take a look at trends with Kickstarter to determine what makes for a successfull fundraising campaign.

Some interesting finds:

- Kickstarter is incredibly popular for raising funds for playmakers and small theater projects.
- The technology category has the highest percentage of cancelled campaigns.  Tech is risky.
- The number of campaigns peaked in 2015 then took a dive.  Maybe this is indicative of a maturing of the market for kickstarter investing.
